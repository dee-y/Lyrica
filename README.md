**An Open Source SQLite Database Lyrics Android Application**

This application is powered by SQLite Database to store the lyrics of music which you can customize!

To add lyrics to the app you can direcly edit the SQLite file in `/src/main/assets/databases/lyrica.db`


I recommend using this app:
  * [SQLiteBrowser](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser) :octocat:
  
  
Download the APK:
  * [Version 1.0](https://github.com/lfasmpao/Lyrica/releases/download/1.0/app-release-unsigned.apk)
  * [Pre-release](https://github.com/lfasmpao/Lyrica/releases/download/0.1/app-debug.apk)
